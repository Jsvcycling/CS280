Mutability

Percy Bysshe Shelley, 1792 - 1822

We  are as clouds that veil the midnight moon; How
restlessly  they  speed,  and  gleam,  and quiver,
Streaking  the darkness radiantly!--yet soon Night
closes   round,   and   they   are  lost  forever:

Or  like  forgotten lyres, whose dissonant strings
Give  various  response  to each varying blast, To
whose frail frame no second motion brings One mood
or modulation like the last.

We rest.--
-A   dream
has  power
to  poison
rise.--One
 wandering
  pollutes
the   day;
We   feel,
conceive -
or reason,
laugh   or
weep; Emb-
race  fond
woe, or c-
ast our c-
ares away:

It  is  the  same!--For,  be  it  joy or
sorrow,  The path of its departure still
is  free:  Man's  yesterday may ne'er be
like  his  morrow; Nought may endure but
Mutability.
